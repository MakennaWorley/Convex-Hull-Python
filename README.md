# Convex Hull

Final Project for CMPT 306 Algorithms

Constructing convex hulls around the US Cities dataset from the Bridges package using brute force and divide and conquer
algorithms. For the larger hulls with many points, this can take upwards of 20 minutes for the brute force.

There is a jupyter notebook and the html file with already compiled code. If you want to run this, I would suggest using
the testing.py file instead of running the jupyter notebook.

If you want to test on datasets larger than the east coast (just over 5 thousand datapoints), you will have to filter by
population as well.
